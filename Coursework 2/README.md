This repository contains the files for coursework 2.

This coursework focuses on implementing a Flight Planner which uses a graph library to represent airline data.

Two datasets are provided, one containing Flight data and the other containing Airport data. The airprot dataset contains airport codes for all airports in the world while the flight dataset contains flight codes,departure and arrival time, and flight path for all flights in the world.

The program functions in two ways. The first functionality is (HelloFlyPlanner.java) : 

The program displays a few flight paths with their costs. The user is asked to choose a starting and a destination airport from the given cities. With the user input, the program displays the flight itinerary with the cost.

The second functionality is (FlyPlannerMain.java) :

The program asks the user to enter a starting and a destination airport. Using the user input, the program displays a flight path with the least cost. The user is also asked if they want to exclude any airports from their flight path. The user is shown the cost, no. of connections, total flight duration etc.

More information is available in the Project Report.
